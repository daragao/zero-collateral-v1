**me playing around with the Zero Collateral V1 Protocol which seems a cool project**

# Zero Collateral V1 Protocol
Zero Collateral V1 is a composition of smart contracts which create the potocol. These contracts enable digital asset holders
on the Ethereum blockchain to engage in decentralized, lending and borrowing acitivites, with down to zero collateral.

The protocol is currently in beta and deployed on the Ropsten testnet. We envision the protocol to evolve into a decentralized, community run project, maintained by a Zero Collateral DAO
(Decentralized Autonomous Organization) structure. 

To expand possibilites of undercollateralized DeFi, we are exploring intergrations with https://www.stratosphere.network/. Interoperability with
the Stratosphere Blockchain will enable the project to tie directly into the benefits of major cloud resources, while maintaining decentralization.

If you would like to contribute, we encourage you to subimt a PR directly or join the open source team at opensource@fabrx.io.
